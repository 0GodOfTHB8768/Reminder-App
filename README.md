## 📝 What is Reminder-App?

Reminder-App is a simple and fun way to keep track of your tasks. It turns your to-do list into a football game. When you finish a task on time, you score a touchdown. If you finish late, you get a field goal. Missing a deadline means you lose the ball. It helps you stay on top of your work and adds a little fun to deadlines.

You can even scan handwritten notes from a special bracelet to add tasks quickly. Plus, you can choose your favorite NFL team's colors to personalize the look. Built using modern web tools, Reminder-App works smoothly on many devices.
